<p>You, brave soul, was once a mighty warior. Numerous fables were wirtten about your glorious battles. The combat that lead to you fall still bring fear, as do the name of the knight of death who defeted you.</p>

<p>In this world "spiritual energy" is the word that lead to all others. Even if you have your own, geizers of souls can provide additional source.</p>

<p>You have passed out but yet you are not alone. All your fallen peoples, still begging to serve your glory, cowering in the shadow of your Crytpe, are at you disposal, awaiting to get engouth spiritual energy form you for combat.</p>

<p>But, beware, this is not all what there is ...</p>

<p>Every cycle, the grand "after" changes, new rooms, new opponent and still the same rule, war. War for spiritual energy. Sprits, summoning hordes of creatures, unleashing deadly spells, until there only one left</p>

<p>Maybe someone will someday discover where fallen spirit goes whene defeted in the arena some come back, some ...</p>

<p>Another cycle is comming you should prepare for battle ready you troops, there is war ahead.</p>
